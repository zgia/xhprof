# xhprof for PHP7
XHProf is a function-level hierarchical profiler for PHP and has a simple HTML based navigational interface. The raw data collection component is implemented in C (as a PHP extension). The reporting/UI layer is all in PHP. It is capable of reporting function-level inclusive and exclusive wall times, memory usage, CPU times and number of calls for each function. Additionally, it supports ability to compare two runs (hierarchical DIFF reports), or aggregate results from multiple runs.

This version supports PHP7

#新增
####pdo占位符转换
pdo预处理占位符将会转换成实际的参数，更好的掌握mysql执行消耗(只用做xhprof记录，不改变程序执行过程)
```php
$_sth = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM user where userid = :id and username = :name");
$_sth->execute([':id' => '1', ':name' => 'admin']);
$data1 = $_sth->fetch();

$_sth = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM user where userid = ?");
$_sth->execute([1]);
$data2 = $_sth->fetch();
```
#####xhprof记录数据
```
PDOStatement::execute#SELECT * FROM user where userid = 1 and username = admin

PDOStatement::execute#SELECT * FROM user where userid = 1
```

####curl地址记录
```php
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "http://www.baidu.com");
$output = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
```
#####xhprof记录数据
```
curl_exec#http://www.baidu.com
